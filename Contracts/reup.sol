/** Reason for seperation of ERC20 , NFT, EXCHANGE ETHER FUNCTION, AND INVENTORY IS SO THAT THE MAIN INVENTORY IS SEPERATE FROM ALL CONTRACTS,
 * THIS IS SO THE INVENTORY IS THE SAME TO EACH CONTRACT.
 * THE REASON FOR THIS: HERE WAS AN ISSUE WHERE EACH CONTRACT HAD IT'S OWN INSTANCE OF INVENTORY CREATING A SEPERATION OF INVENTORY SUPPLY IN BOTH ERC721 AND ERC20
 * EVEN THE INVENTORY CONTRACT'S SUPPLY WAS SEPERATE FROM ALL OTHER CONTRACTS
 * I.E. : ERC20 HAD 100 SUPPLY INVENTORY WHEN SUPPLY WAS DEDUCTED ONLY THE DEPLOYED ERC20 INVENTORY SUPPLY WAS DEDUCTED
 * THE MAIN INVENTORY CONTRACT WAS NOT DEDUCTED NOR WAS THE ERC721 INVENTORY SUPPLY DEDUCTED
 * THIS IS BECAUSE CONTRACT FUNCTIONS AND VARIABLES ARE ONLY INHERITED LOCAL AND CANNOT BE CHANGED GLOBALLY ACROSS ALL CONTRACTS
 * THE FIX IS TO SEPERATE ALL CONTRACTS
 * CREATE A GETTER FUNCTION TO CALL INVENTORY AND DEDUCT INVENTORY FROM APPROVED CONTRACTS,****PRIORITY LEARNING****
 * POSSIBLE FUNCTION TO CREATE CONTRACT THAT APPROVES CONTRACTS CREATED FROM IT ****PRIORITY LEARNING****
 * CREATE GETTER FUNCTION THAT CAN MINT ERC20s and ERC721s WHENEVER A USER BUYS WITHOUT NEEDING TO CLAIM ****PRIORITY LEARNING****
 * MY IDEA IS THAT I CAN CREATE A MASTER MINT FUNCTION ON THE INVENTORY CONTRACT OR EXCHANGE ETH CONTRACT 
 * THE MASTER MINT FUNCTION WILL CONNECT ERC20 ERC721 AND INVENTORY VIA EXCHANGE ETH FUNCTION
 * A MAPPING OF TRUE OR NOT WILL EITHER AUTOMATICALLY DEPLOY A ADDRESS AND ADD IT TO THE MAPPING TO SAY IT'S APPROVED TO MINT ERC20S AND ERC721
 * MASTER MINT FUNCTION WILL GO IN BOTH ERC20 AND ERC721 FUNCTION
 * WHEN A PERSON BUYS VIA EXCHANGEETH FUNCTION IT DEDUCTS FROM MAIN INVENTORY CONTRACT, ADDING THE ADDRESS TO THE STRUCT AND THE SUPPLY BOUGHT
 * THE ERC20 MASTER MINT FUNCTION IS CALLED , IT USES A GETTER FUNCTION TO MINT TOKENS BASED ON HOW MANY ITEMS IS BOUGHT
 * PER PURCHASE A NFT IS MINTED FROM THE ERC721 CONTRACT ALSO
 * A REQUIRE STATEMENT IS NEEDED ON THE ERC20, ERC721, AND EXCHANGE ETH CONTRACT BECAUSE ALL FUNCTIONS ARE PUBLIC 
 * AND WOULD REQUIRE ONLY CERTAIN CONTRACT BE ABLE TO CALL THOSE FUNCTIONS.
